# counter app

A small counter-app. You can increment and decrement the counter and save the counts of the current session 
(the saved counts are displayed on the screen). 

It's a small project for learning HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

Originally, I wanted to create the 'passenger-counter-app' from a tutorial of freeCodeCamp.org, 
but I didn't liked the design, therefore I changed the design and also added the functionality for decrementing the counter.
